X232: greenTicket
CodingBat: https://codingbat.com/prob/p120633
You have a green lottery ticket, with ints a, b, and c on it. If the numbers are all different from each other, the result is 0. If all of the numbers are the same, the result is 20. If two of the numbers are the same, the result is 10.

public int greenTicket(int a, int b, int c)
{
    if (a == b && a == c)
        return 20;
    if (a == b || b == c || a == c)
        return 10;
    
    return 0;
}

X18: blueTicket
CodingBat: https://codingbat.com/prob/p192267
Write a function in Java that implements the following logic: You have a blue lottery ticket, with ints a, b, and c on it. This makes three pairs, which we'll call ab, bc, and ac. Consider the sum of the numbers in each pair. If any pair sums to exactly 10, the result is 10. Otherwise if the ab sum is exactly 10 more than either bc or ac sums, the result is 5. Otherwise the result is 0.
public int blueTicket(int a, int b, int c)
{
    int ab = a + b;
    int bc = b + c;
    int ac = a + c;
    
    if (ab == 10 || bc == 10 || ac == 10)
        return 10;
    if (ab == (bc + 10) || ab == (ac + 10))
        return 5;
    
    return 0;
}
